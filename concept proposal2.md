Backstory

The game would take place in a city where the atmosphere would be very dreary using only white grey and black in its color palette. The city would have a lot of crime and a lot of people trying to get by. The city is mostly just a kinda normal place most of the people are just bored with everything tho but occasionally products come out that shake the city everybody wants them but they are usually undercooked and it can get borderline dangerous. That's where the story starts an ad to test a prototype version of something that pays just to use it and to give some reports about the effects.

Some people are being paid to test the product and the main character is one of them. They signed up for this because they are very under paid and this pays very well because it's an experiment that could definitely go wrong. The product is a fleshy chip that is installed directly into the brain and controlled with a mobile app and what it does is when it is turned on it distorts how a person views reality and messes with their senses it basically makes them hallucinate a lot when activated it would turn the bland and boring city with no color into a very colorful but kinda weird place. It would also make everyday tasks seem fun like it could turn giving a speech into a concert and in real life the speech is being given but it feels to the person that they are performing a concert even though they've never touched an instrument in their life, it distorts how the user sees reality a lot.

The main character is someone who doesn't really have anything to stick around for they don't really have anyone. Everyone they once had are gone and they work a dead end job and live in an apartment with an impressive amount of mold. It's just a sad situation but they keep going just cause they want to.

Characters

Name would probably be player chosen or John Doe or maybe the name would never be mentioned by them or anyone 

I think the main character would be kinda blank and tired all the time maybe they would look like an unfinished sketch of a person and they'd only really show some personality when the chip is activated cause their having fun 

At the start of the story their only motivations would be surviving and paying rent but nearing the middle or the end it would be the chip 

There would be a few antagonists like some general people the landlord and the last one would be the people who made the chip eventually trying to take it from him

Target Market / Audience

I think people that would play this are people who like all kinds of games and maybe a bit of a bleaker story 

Probably like late teens and/or early adult cause they can play a lot of games and might enjoy the story

I think if it was done right they'd enjoy the small challenge of the levels and they might also like the story

 Player Motivations

Probably the new levels cause id want them to be over the top and enjoyable and progressing threw the story cause id hope it would be at least decent

Unique Selling Point (USP)

I think the main selling point would be the gameplay the kind of game play im thinking of is like every level would feel like their from different games 

Inspirations & Competition

My main inspirations are warioware and a demo of a game thats not out yet called mindwave even tho this would be nothing like them id be taking the general idea of totally different games in one game out of them and a bit of story inspiration from mindwave i guess

There would be tons of smaller inspirations like some i would like to pull ideas or some style from are hotline miami, undertale, and deltarune

im not sure about competition honestly the idea i have for the gameplay hasn't really been done in any games I've played which might be a good thing to me what i have envisioned for the gameplay would either be a hit or miss 

Goals

Fun cause of the levels and their challenge 

Wonder cause of how many different things there are 

And slight fear in the story
